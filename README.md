# Fibonacci-Binet
A Brief Investigation in Fibonacci and Binet's closed form formula

Three methods
  - Fibonacci where the nth element is generated recursively 
  - Binet where the nth element is generated by his closed form equation
  - TestMachine which loops the former two methods and computes the difference of between the nth element; takes tolerance as its parameter
 
 Mathematically, Binet's equation can generate out its Fibonacci counterpart. I wanted to verify this held true for large values of n. 
 Of course, the proof for Binet's equation is sound, but I wondered if the innate inaccuracy in storing floating would reveal itself in the computation of very large n values. I ran this code on my laptop and the program never terminated (~ 1 minute). I am not patient enough to wait. Note that I chose to cast the Binet value as an int in hopes of encouraging errors, but the program still did not fail to terminate before my patience did. 
 
 Conclusion: Use Binet's Formula
